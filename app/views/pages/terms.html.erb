Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third Party Accounts will be available on and through your Huntivore Account on the Site and Services.

Huntivore makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Huntivore is not responsible for any SNS Content.</span><br /><br /><span>We will create your Huntivore Account and your Huntivore Account profile page for your use of the Site based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Huntivore Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete.

You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Huntivore Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Huntivore of any unauthorized use of your Huntivore Account.</span><br /><br /><strong>Listings</strong><br /><span>As a Member, you may create Listings. To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Accommodations or Property to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, availability of the Accommodation or Property and pricing and related rules and financial terms. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Accommodation or Property via the Site and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a booking of your Listing, the price for such booking may not be altered.</span><br /><br /><span>You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Accommodation or Property included in a Listing you post, including, but not limited to, zoning laws and laws governing rentals of residential and other properties and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. You also acknowledge that by listing your land for hunting purposes you are not in violation of any laws governing your property.</span><br /><br /><span>Please note that Huntivore assumes no responsibility for a Host&rsquo;s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations. Huntivore reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Huntivore, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Site or Services.</span><br /><br /><span>You understand and agree that Huntivore does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for you as a Host. If a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation or Property, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest, and Huntivore is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Huntivore serves as the limited authorized agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting payments from Guests on behalf of the Host and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Host.</span><br /><br /><span>You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation or Property at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation or Property, if applicable.)</span><br /><br /><span>Huntivore recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Accommodations, Property and Business (if applicable). Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Accommodation and Property carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation or Property, if applicable) while at your Accommodation or Property.</span><br /><br /><strong>No Endorsement</strong><br /><span>Huntivore does not endorse any Members or any Accommodations or Property. In addition, although these Terms require Members to provide accurate information, we do not attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Member&rsquo;s purported identity. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you contact via the Site and Services. </span><br /><br /><span>By using the Site or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from Huntivore with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Host against Huntivore regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by Huntivore on behalf of a Host, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled &ldquo;Limitation of Liability&rdquo;.</span><br /><br /><strong>Bookings and Financial Terms</strong><br /><br /><em><strong>Bookings and Financial Terms for Hosts </strong></em><br /><span>If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Accommodation or Property via the Site and Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking within the given time limit of when the booking is requested (as determined by Huntivore in its sole discretion) or the booking request will be automatically cancelled. When a booking is requested via the Site and Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the booking, a link to the Guest&rsquo;s Huntivore Account profile page so that you can view such information before confirming or rejecting the booking. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of an Accommodation or Property within such 24 hour period, any amounts collected by Huntivore for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest&rsquo;s credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Guest, Huntivore will send you an email confirming such booking.</span><br /><br /><span>The fees displayed in each Listing are comprised of the Booking Fees (defined below) and the Guest Fees (defined below.) Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Booking Fees and Guest Fees. The Booking Fees, the Guest Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the &ldquo;</span><strong>Total Fees</strong><span>&rdquo;. The amounts due and payable by a Guest solely relating to a Host&rsquo;s Accommodation or Property are the &ldquo;</span><strong>Booking Fees</strong><span>&rdquo;. Please note that it is the Host and not Huntivore which determines the Booking Fees. The Booking Fee may include a cleaning fee, at the Host&rsquo;s discretion.</span><br /><br /><span>Huntivore charges a fee to Guests based upon a percentage of applicable Booking Fees which are the &ldquo;</span><strong>Guest Fees</strong><span>&rdquo;. The Guest Fees are added to the Booking Fees to calculate the Total Fees (which will also include applicable Taxes) displayed in the applicable Listing. Huntivore will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when the Host confirms the booking within the given time of the booking request) and will initiate payment of the Booking Fees (less Huntivore&rsquo;s Host Fees (defined below)) to the Host within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Accommodation or Property (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Guest).</span><br /><br /><strong>Appointment of Huntivore as Payment Agent for Host </strong><br /><span>Each Host hereby appoints Huntivore as the Host&rsquo;s limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Guests on behalf of the Host. Each Host agrees that payment made by a Guest to Huntivore shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host and the Host will make the Accommodation or Property available to Guest in the agreed upon manner as if the Host has received the Booking Fees. Each Host agrees that, Huntivore may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Guest to cancel the booking and (ii) refund to the Guest that portion of the Booking Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, Huntivore assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.</span><br /><br /><span>Please note that Huntivore does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you acknowledge and agree that Huntivore reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that Huntivore will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.</span><br /><br /><strong>Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests </strong><br /><span>The Hosts, not Huntivore, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations or Property reserved through the Site and Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of an Accommodation or Property, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host, and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation or Property imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Huntivore, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Huntivore is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Huntivore disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Huntivore is not a party to the agreement between you and the Host, Huntivore acts as the Host&rsquo;s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Host. Upon your payment of amounts to Huntivore which are due to the Host, your payment obligation to the Host for such amounts is extinguished, and Huntivore is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Huntivore&rsquo;s Host Fees, to the Host. In the event that Huntivore does not remit any such amounts to a Host, such Host will have recourse only against Huntivore.</span><br /><br /><span>Listings for Accommodations or Property will specify the Total Fees. As noted above, the Host is required to either confirm or reject the booking within the given time limit of when the booking is requested (as determined by Huntivore in its sole discretion) or the requested booking will be automatically cancelled. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Huntivore will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site, and any pre-authorization of such Guest&rsquo;s credit card will be released, if applicable.</span><br /><br /><span>You agree to pay Huntivore for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Huntivore Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Host. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Host&rsquo;s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Huntivore, on behalf of the Host, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting ( e.g. one euro or one British pound) to verify your credit card. Once Huntivore receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Host, Huntivore will collect the Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Huntivore cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Huntivore&rsquo;s collection of the Total Fees, and Huntivore disclaims all liability in this regard.</span><br /><br /><span>In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Huntivore or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Huntivore for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Huntivore Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site &ndash; e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Huntivore or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site. You also authorize Huntivore to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at an Accommodation or Property as contemplated under &ldquo;Damage to Accommodations&rdquo; below and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Huntivore&rsquo;s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party&rsquo;s service and that third party&rsquo;s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</span><br /><br /><strong>Security Deposits</strong><br /><span>Hosts may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (&ldquo;</span><strong>Security Deposits</strong><span>&rdquo;). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Accommodation or Property. If a Security Deposit is included in a Listing for a confirmed booking of Accommodation or Property, Huntivore will, in its capacity as the payment agent of the Host, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a pre-authorization of the Guest&rsquo;s credit card in the amount the Host determines for the Security Deposit within a reasonable time prior to the Guest&rsquo;s check-in at the applicable Host&rsquo;s Accommodation or Property. Huntivore will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts&rsquo; requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Huntivore is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</span><br /><br /><strong>Service Fees</strong><br /><span>In consideration for providing the Services, Huntivore collects service fees from Hosts and Guests (&ldquo;</span><strong>Service Fees</strong><span>&rdquo;). Service Fees are made up of two (2) components: (i) Guest Fees and (ii) a fee that is charged to the Host based upon a percentage of the amount of the Booking Fees (&ldquo;</span><strong>Host Fees</strong><span>&rdquo;). Where applicable, Taxes may also be charged in addition to the Host Fees. Host Fees are deducted from the Booking Fees before remitting the Booking Fees to the Host. Guest Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees. </span><br /><br /><span>Balances will be remitted by Huntivore to Hosts via check, PayPal, direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site, in the Host&rsquo;s currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Host makes via the Site and Services. Please note that for any payments by Huntivore in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Huntivore may deduct foreign currency processing costs from such payments. More information on foreign currency processing cost deductions will be available via the Site. </span><br /><br /></p> 
	<h3 dir="ltr"><span>General Booking and Financial Terms</span></h3> 
	<p><strong>Cancellations and Refunds </strong><br /><span>If, as a Guest, you cancel your requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed by a Host, Huntivore will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested booking within a commercially reasonable time. If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site and Services, either prior to or after arriving at the Accommodation or Property, the cancellation policy of the Host contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Booking Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site.</span><br /><br /><span>If a Host cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site and Services, (i) Huntivore will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Guest within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Guest will receive an email or other communication from Huntivore containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Guest requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Host associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Guest&rsquo;s requested booking, then the Guest agrees to pay Huntivore the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Accommodation in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If a Host cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Guest, have not received an email or other communication from Huntivore, please </span><span>contact Huntivore here.</span><br /><br /><br /><strong>Donations</strong><br /><span>Some Hosts may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not control, and will not take any responsibility or liability for, whether the Host does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make.</span><br /><br /><strong>Taxes</strong><br /><span>IRS regulation, regarding federal tax reporting requirements, stipulates that Huntivore must collect IRS Form W-9 from all property owners in the United States. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your applicable Tax reporting requirements in consultation with your tax advisors. Huntivore cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members of the Site and Services. Additionally, please note that each Host is responsible for determining local indirect Taxes and for including any applicable Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. Where applicable, or based upon request from a Host, Huntivore may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Host.</span><br /><br /></p> 
	<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Damage to Accommodations </span></h3>

You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation or Property.</span><br /><br /><span>If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that Huntivore reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make a claim under your homeowner&rsquo;s, renter&rsquo;s or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation or Property (including amounts paid by Huntivore). You agree to cooperate with and assist Huntivore in good faith, and to provide Huntivore with such information as may be reasonably requested by Huntivore in order to make a claim under your homeowner&rsquo;s, renter&rsquo;s or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Huntivore may reasonably request to assist Huntivore in accomplishing the foregoing.</span><br /><br /><strong>User Conduct</strong><br /><span>You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with any and all laws, rules, regulations, and Tax obligations that may apply to your use of the Site, Services and Content.

You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Sacramento County, Sacramento, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties </span><strong>retain the right to seek </strong><span>injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, </span><strong>as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong><br /><span>You and Huntivore agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site (collectively, &ldquo;</span><strong>Disputes</strong><span>&rdquo;) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Huntivore are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Huntivore otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section will survive any termination of these Terms.</span><br /><br /><span>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) then in effect, except as modified by this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section. (The AAA Rules are available at </span><a href="/web/20130401042507/http://www.adr.org/arb_med"><span>http://www.adr.org/arb_med</span></a><span> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</span><br /><br /><span>Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at </span><a href="/web/20130401042507/http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175"><span>http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</span></a><span> and a separate form for California residents at </span><a href="/web/20130401042507/http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314"><span>http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314</span></a><span>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA&rsquo;s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</span><br /><br /><span>Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Huntivore otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Huntivore submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</span><br /><span>Arbitrator&rsquo;s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the &ldquo;Limitation of Liability&rdquo; section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&rsquo;s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Huntivore will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</span><br /><br /><strong>Fees</strong><br /><span>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Huntivore will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</span><br /><span>Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the &ldquo;Modification&rdquo; section above, if Huntivore changes this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to </span><span>admin@Huntivore.com</span><span>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &ldquo;Last Updated Date&rdquo; above or in the date of Huntivore&rsquo;s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Huntivore in accordance with the provisions of this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</span><br /><br /><strong>General</strong><br /><span>The failure of Huntivore to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Huntivore. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</span><br /><br /><strong>Contacting Huntivore</strong><br /><span>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact Huntivore at </span><span>admin@Huntivore.com</span><span>.</span></p>
